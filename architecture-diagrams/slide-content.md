## 🎤 **Speaker Notes**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
"I've built a modern dog adoption platform using AWS serverless architecture. Today I'll show you what's working, the technical foundation I've created, and the exciting AI features planned."

### **Architecture (1 minute)**
"The architecture follows AWS best practices with serverless components. React frontend connects through Cognito authentication to API Gateway, which triggers Lambda functions that interact with encrypted DynamoDB tables and S3 storage."

### **Demo (2 minutes)**
"Let me show you what's working today. Users can browse available dogs, shelters can add new dogs with photos, and the wag/growl system tracks user preferences."

### **Future Vision (1 minute)**
"The remaining 50% focuses on AI integration - automatic breed detection, sentiment analysis of photos, and smart dog recommendations using machine learning."

### **Closing (30 seconds)**
"I've built a solid, secure foundation that's 50% complete with core functionality working. The roadmap is clear for AI-powered features that will differentiate this platform."
